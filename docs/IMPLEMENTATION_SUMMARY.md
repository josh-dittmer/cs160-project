# Admin RBAC Implementation Summary

## Implementation Complete ✅

All features from the plan have been successfully implemented.

## What Was Built

### Backend (Python/FastAPI)

1. **Database Schema Changes**
   - ✅ Added `role` field to User model (`backend/app/models.py`)
   - ✅ Default role is "customer"
   - ✅ Supports: admin, manager, employee, customer

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - ✅ Updated `UserCtx` to include role (`backend/app/auth.py`)
   - ✅ Created `require_admin()` dependency for admin-only routes
   - ✅ Created `require_role()` factory for flexible role checking

3. **Admin API Endpoints** (`backend/app/routers/admin.py`)
   - ✅ User Management:
     - `GET /api/admin/users` - List all users
     - `PUT /api/admin/users/{id}/role` - Change user role
     - `PUT /api/admin/users/{id}/block` - Block/unblock user
   - ✅ Inventory Management:
     - `GET /api/admin/items` - List items with filters (defaults to active)
     - `GET /api/admin/items/{id}` - Get single item
     - `POST /api/admin/items` - Create new item
     - `PUT /api/admin/items/{id}` - Update item
     - `DELETE /api/admin/items/{id}` - Deactivate item
     - `PUT /api/admin/items/{id}/activate` - Activate/deactivate item

4. **Schemas** (`backend/app/schemas.py`)
   - ✅ Updated `UserOut` with role field
   - ✅ Created admin-specific schemas: `UserListAdmin`, `UserRoleUpdate`, `UserBlockUpdate`
   - ✅ Created item schemas: `ItemCreate`, `ItemUpdate`, `ItemActivateUpdate`

5. **Database Seeding** (`backend/app/seed.py`)
   - ✅ Automatically creates admin user with hardcoded credentials
   - ✅ Email: `admin@sjsu.edu`, Password: `admin123`
   - ✅ Idempotent (checks if admin exists before creating)
   - ✅ **Single Admin Model**: Only one admin allowed in the system

### Frontend (TypeScript/Next.js/React)

1. **API Client** (`frontend/src/lib/api/`)
   - ✅ Updated `UserInfo` interface with role field (`auth.ts`)
   - ✅ Created complete admin API client (`admin.ts`)
   - ✅ Type-safe functions for all user and inventory operations

2. **Admin Dashboard** (`frontend/src/app/admin/`)
   - ✅ **Layout** (`layout.tsx`): 
     - Admin navigation bar with Dashboard, Users, Inventory tabs
     - "View as Customer" button
     - Role-based route protection
   - ✅ **Dashboard Page** (`dashboard/page.tsx`):
     - System statistics (users, items, stock levels)
     - User role breakdown
     - Quick action links
   - ✅ **Users Page** (`users/page.tsx`):
     - Table view of all users
     - Filter by role and status
     - Inline role change dropdown
     - Block/unblock buttons
     - Protection against self-modification
   - ✅ **Inventory Page** (`inventory/page.tsx`):
     - Grid view with item cards
     - Search by name/description
     - Filter by status (active/inactive/all)
     - Create/Edit modal form
     - Deactivate/Activate buttons
     - Low stock indicators

3. **Customer View Feature** (`frontend/src/app/home/layout.tsx`)
   - ✅ Green banner when admin views as customer
   - ✅ "Exit to Admin" button in banner
   - ✅ Seamless role detection using auth context

### Documentation

1. ✅ **ADMIN.md**: Complete admin documentation with:
   - Role descriptions and capabilities
   - Setup instructions
   - API endpoint reference
   - Security considerations
   - Changes from previous version

2. ✅ **README.md**: Updated with:
   - Admin credentials in setup section
   - Role-based access control feature
   - Link to ADMIN.md

## Testing Checklist

### Backend Tests
- [ ] Start backend: `PYTHONPATH=. uvicorn backend.app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000` or use `./scripts/backendctl.sh start`
- [ ] Verify API docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- [ ] Check admin endpoints appear in API docs
- [ ] Test admin endpoints require authentication

### Database Tests
- [ ] Delete old database: `rm backend/sqlite.db`
- [ ] Run seed script: `PYTHONPATH=. python -m backend.app.seed`
- [ ] Verify admin user created message appears
- [ ] Check database has users table with role column

### Frontend Tests
- [ ] Start frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
- [ ] Login as admin: `admin@sjsu.edu` / `admin123`
- [ ] Verify redirect to `/admin/dashboard`
- [ ] Check dashboard statistics load
- [ ] Test user management (view, filter, role change, block)
- [ ] Test inventory management (view, search, filter, create, edit, deactivate)
- [ ] Test "View as Customer" button
- [ ] Verify customer view banner appears
- [ ] Test "Exit to Admin" button returns to admin panel
- [ ] Login as regular user and verify `/admin` routes redirect to `/home/dashboard`

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Create new item via admin panel
- [ ] Verify item appears in customer view
- [ ] Deactivate item
- [ ] Verify item disappears from customer view but visible in admin (with filter)
- [ ] Create new user via signup
- [ ] Promote user to manager via admin panel
- [ ] Verify role persists after logout/login

## Known Limitations

1. **Single Admin Model**: Only one admin account exists in the system. This is a design choice for simplicity and security.

2. **Manager and Employee Roles**: Currently have same permissions as customers. Specific permissions to be defined in future sprints.

3. **No Audit Logging**: Changes to users and inventory are not logged. Consider adding in future for compliance.

4. **No Bulk Operations**: Admin must modify users/items one at a time.

5. **No Image Upload**: Items require external image URLs. Local upload feature would be useful.

6. **No Email Notifications**: Users are not notified when roles change or accounts are blocked.

## Future Enhancements

- Audit logging system
- Admin analytics dashboard
- Bulk operations (import/export CSV)
- Image upload for inventory items
- Email notifications
- Advanced filtering and sorting
- Role-specific permissions for manager/employee
- Search functionality in user management

## Security Notes

- Admin endpoints protected by JWT + role check
- **Single admin architecture**: Only one admin account allowed (prevents admin conflicts)
- Admin cannot modify own role or block themselves
- Cannot create additional admins (enforced by backend and frontend)
- All item deletions are soft deletes (is_active = False)
- Passwords are properly hashed using bcrypt
- CORS configured for localhost development

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:
- [ ] Change default admin password
- [ ] Set secure SECRET_KEY in environment variables
- [ ] Update CORS settings to production domain
- [ ] Set up proper database backups
- [ ] Enable HTTPS
- [ ] Review and restrict admin access
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
